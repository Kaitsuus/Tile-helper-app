# APU Expo App

This is a README file for this APU Expo app. It provides an overview of the project structure and highlights the key directories and files.

## Project Structure

The project structure of this Expo app looks as follows:

├── assets/

├── screens/

├── services/

│ ├── firebase/

├── src/

│ ├── components/

│ ├── data/

│ ├── styles/

└── App.js


Here's a brief description of each directory and its purpose:

- **assets**: This directory is intended for storing static assets such as images, fonts, and other resources used in your app.
- **screens**: The `screens` directory contains the screen components of your app. Each screen represents a separate view or UI element.
- **services**: The `services` directory is meant for housing different service modules or utilities used within your app. In this case, there is a `firebase` subdirectory, indicating the integration with Firebase services.
- **src**: The `src` directory is the main directory for your source code. It contains various subdirectories where you organize your code.
  - **components**: The `components` directory contains reusable UI components that are used across different screens or sections of your app.
  - **data**: The `data` directory may contain data files, JSON files, or modules that handle data retrieval or management.
  - **styles**: The `styles` directory is used for storing CSS or styling-related files. It includes stylesheets, theme files, or modules for handling app styles.

Additionally, there is a file named `App.js`. This is the entry point of your Expo app and serves as the starting point for your application's execution.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Expo app, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have Expo CLI installed globally. If not, you can install it by running `npm install -g expo-cli`.
3. Install the app dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project root directory.
4. Run the app using the command `expo start` or `npm start`/`yarn start`.
5. Expo will start a development server and provide you with options to run the app on an emulator, a connected device, or a web browser.
